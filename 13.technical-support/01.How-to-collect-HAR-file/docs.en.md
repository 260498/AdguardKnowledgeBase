Select “Developer Tools” in the menu:

Click on the Network tab.
Find the round button in the upper left corner of the tab. It should be red. If it is gray, click it to start recording.
Tick the "Preserve Log" checkbox to enable logging.
To clear unnecessary data, click on the crossed out circle icon ("Clear" button next to the red recording button).
Reproduce the error.
Save the network log into a HAR file by right-clicking on any entry in the log and selecting "Save all as HAR with content".

Stop HttpWatch recording after the error is reproduced.
