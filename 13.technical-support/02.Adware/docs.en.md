## What's Adware?
**Adware** - programs that are designed to display ads on your computer, redirect search queries to ad websites, and collect marketing information about you (such as what kind of sites you visit) to ensure that your ad is in your best interest.

**Adware programs* collect data with your consent should not be confused with Trojan spyware programs that collect information without your permission and knowledge. If Adware does not notify you that it is collecting information, it is considered malicious, such as the Trojan-Spy malware.

## What you need to know about Adware
With the exception of advertising and data collection, such programs are usually not present in the system. Basicly such a program does not have an icon on the taskbar, and it is also absent from the program menu.

Adware programs can be downloaded to your computer in two main ways:

- #### With free or semi-free software
Adware programs may be included as part of some free or semi-free programs as part of the advertising component. Revenues from such advertising help finance their development.

- #### Through infected websites
Visiting an infected website may result in the unauthorized installation of Adware on your computer. Hacking technologies are often used for this purpose. For example, a browser vulnerability and Trojan hacker software designed for invisible installation of Adware may be used to infiltrate your computer. Adware programs that work in this way are often called Browser Hijackers.

## How to clean your system from Adware?

In the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using **[AdwareCleaner](https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/adwcleaner)** from **Malwarebytes**. This application is quite easy to use and you can test it by yourself.

After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, you should take the following steps:
