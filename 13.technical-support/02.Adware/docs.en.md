If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open.

## How to clean your system from Adware?

In the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using **[AdwareCleaner](https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/adwcleaner)** from **Malwarebytes**. This application is quite easy to use and you can test it by yourself.

After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, you should take the following steps:

1) Start the application and tap **scan now**.

2) Once the scan has been completed, you will need to send suspicious objects to **quarantine**.

3) When the items are moved to **quarantine**, you will be able to **clear the system** of unnecessary ballast.
4) In some cases, you may need to **reboot the system** after cleaning is complete.
