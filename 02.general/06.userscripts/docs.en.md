## Introduction

First, let's get it clear. What is a userscript? Userscripts (we also call them 'extensions' sometimes) de-facto are mini-programs written in Javascript. They modify or extend functionality of one or more websites. Many AdGuard users must be already familiar with such userscripts as [AdGuard Assistant](#assistant), [PopupBlocker](#popupblocker) and [AdGuard Extra](#extra).

These userscripts have been developed by AdGuard team but there are, of course, thousands and thousands more. You can install any of them to make your browser look and behave according to your preferences. Further we'll be talking about extensions available by default in different AdGuard products and about how to find more.

## Recommended scripts

>### ATTENTION
>These userscripts come directly from AdGuard developers and we can guarantee that they will be effective and safe. Keep in mind that whenever you download a userscript from an unknown source you expose yourself to a risk. Some scripts can be harmful to your computer. Always get new scripts only from [trustworthy sources](#repo).


<a name="assistant"></a>
### AdGuard Assistant

This extension lets you manage the filtering process right from the page. Assistant is present in AdGuard apps for Windows and Mac and looks like a round icon with AG logo on it in the corner of the web page. With its help you can, for example, manually block any element on the page, report a website or whitelist it.


<a name="extra"></a>
### AdGuard Extra

This extension has joined the AdGuard userscript family fairly recently. Its first and foremost task is to block ads in complicated cases when usual filter-based filtering may not be enough. A good example is ads in Facebook feed.


<a name="popupblocker"></a>
### PopupBlocker

The name speaks for itself. It helps get rid of popups - one of the most irritating type of ads out there. It is currently available in AdGuard for MAc and AdGuard for Windows.


<a name="apps"></a>
## Supported apps

At the time this article is written, there are three AdGuard products that support userscripts: AdGuard for Windows, AdGuard for Mac and AdGuard for Android.


<a name="windows"></a>
### AdGuard for Windows

AdGuard's app for Windows has been supporting userscripts for a long time. To find scripts installed by default and add new ones (by URL or from a local file), go to the "Extensions" tab of AdGuard Settings. 


<a name="android"></a>
### AdGuard for Android

AdGuard for Android also can be used to install any userscripts from the Internet of from a local file. To do so, open the menu and proceed to "Settings > Extensions". You'll find a couple of pre-installed scripts there, as well as a "New Extension" button. Note that for any userscripts to work, the switch in the top right corner of the screen should be switched on.

<a name="mac"></a>
### AdGuard for Mac

Unlike other AdGuard apps, Mac version doesn't provide an option to install new scripts (yet). Despite that, there are a few useful userscripts available by default inside the "Extensions" tab of the settings.

## Where can you get more userscripts?

Userscripts are mostly created by enthusiasts, that is why you need to be careful when installing a new one. But nevertheless, there is a great variety of interesting scripts that can really make the use of some websites more convenient.

Here we will describe some of the most popular userscript catalogs.

[Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) is a catalog of user styles, but it allows you to load them as userscripts. Thus, any user style can be installed via AdGuard. Be careful if you decide to install an unpopular script - there's a risk it might be harmful.


<a name="greasyfork"></a>
### <img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/PicturesEN/gs.png" width="25"> Greasy Fork

[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/) is a userscript catalog by [Stylish](#userstyles) creators. In contrast to the aforemntioned usersstyles.org, scripts in this catalog undergo moderation, so their credibility is much higher.


<a name="openUserJs"></a>
### <img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/kb/PicturesEN/js.png" width="25">  OpenUserJS.org

[OpenUserJS.org](https://openuserjs.org/) is an open source userscript catalog written in nodeJS. It doesn't have moderation so stay alert to any suspicious scripts.
