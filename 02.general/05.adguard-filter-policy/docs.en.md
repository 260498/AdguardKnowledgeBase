When discussing AdGuard ad filters, there is often one topic that causes disputes – whether shall AdGuard block this or that ad. By framing the rules we stick to special criteria. Our criteria are much similar to [EasyList Policy](https://easylist.to/pages/policy.html), which we find correct and appropriate. Nevertheless, we've made some changes to it.

## Common criteria

These equally apply to rules in all filters.

- Rules that often cause problems with work of some websites will be deleted.
- Rules that are specific to a particular website will be added only if the website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if it has such) or in other ways, for example social media following. Website’s traffic is considered sufficient when it has 30 thousands visitors a month.


## Ad filters

This part describes AdGuard Base filter, Mobile ads filter and following language-specific filters: Russian, German, Dutch, Spanish/Portuguese, Japanese, Turkish, French.

##### What shall these filters block?

- These filters shall block ads wherever possible. 
- Ads shall be blocked regardless of reasons and goals of such ad.
- We will block ads caused by malicious apps or extensions that inject ads. Please note that we do it only on condition that you will specify how to install this app or extension.

##### Limitations and Exceptions

If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to main filters.

- Websites’ own ads are not to be removed on purpose. On the other side it shouldn’t be unblocked, because such unblocking can cause displaying of third-party ads.
- Rules that are specific to a particular website will be added only if the website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if it has such) or in other ways, for example social media following. Website’s traffic is considered sufficient when it has 30 thousands visitors a month.
- Anti-adblock scripts will be blocked only if they limit functionality of the website or interfere with its use.
- Anti-adblock scripts will not be blocked in cases when it is prohibited by Law.
- Rules that often cause problems with work of some websites will be deleted.

## Quality requirements for filtering rules

- The rules should be as efficient as possible in terms of performance.
- Exception rules shall be as much specific as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary unblocking.
- CSS and JS injection rules shall be used as rarely as possible, and only in case when ad blocking is impossible without them.
