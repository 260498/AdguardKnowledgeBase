## Extension and Program Integration

If you use Adguard, our browser extension may become a very useful additional tool, which will completely replace the browser-based “Adguard Assistant” module.

How does Adguard extension work in integration mode with Adguard for Windows or macOS?

*  Extension icon color changes to blue;

*  Extension doesn’t filter pages any more - now this function lays completely on desktop program;

*  Extension settings are ignored; instead, desktop program’s settings are used.


## Integration mode features

*  [Enable or disable filtering on a website](#1)
*  [Select and block any element manually](#2)
*  [View filtering log](#3)
*  [Send complaint on a website](#4)
*  [View website security report](#5)

###  Enable or disable filtering on a website
 	
Disabling the filtering on a website, creates an exception rule in the user filter. There are two options to enable the filtering:

1. Using the same switcher in extension, which disabled the filtering;

2. Removing the rule from user filter.

The rule created by Assistant falls into the user filter. This rule can be easily removed in the program.

Note that after sending a complaint, solving the problem may take some time.

If you want to speed up the process, then leave a message about unblocked ads in our [Forum](http://forum.adguard.com/forumdisplay.php?53-Missed-Ads).
