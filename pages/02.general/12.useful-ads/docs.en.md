## Useful ads

**Disclaimer.** The term *'Useful ads'* doesn't imply that we have any kind of 'acceptable ads' program like Adblock Plus and some other adblockers, where they take money for leaving certain ads unblocked. This is not the case. We are not being paid for showing these ads, and we call them 'useful' and not 'acceptable' for a reason - they can be, in fact, helpful. This only refers to the 'search ads' - i.e. ads in search queries results.

Just to make it absolutely clear - this is **completely optional**. You can turn off the display of these ads at any time with no penalty whatsoever. Further we will explain which ads we consider useful.

### Search ads and why we consider them useful

Search ads are ads that you see among the results of a search query when using an online search engine like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo etc.

These ads are always contextual, i.e. they are targeted to match whatever keywords you had used when you made the query. It helps you to find exactly what you are searching for. Moreover, search ads are often more relevant and helpful than the rest of the search results due to being manually moderated.  

Another argument in defense of search ads is that they are much less intrusive than many other ad formats.

### What ads are on the list?

When you enable 'Useful ads', the search ads in the following search engines are unblocked:

* Google;
* Yahoo;
* Bing;
* Ask;
* Yandex;
* DuckDuckGo;
* StartPage.

### Summary

'Allow useful ads' is a 100% optional feature that can be helpful in some cases, and if you don't like it, you are free to disable it at any time. There are no and will never be any types of ads or individual ads included in there, which do not fall under the category described above.
