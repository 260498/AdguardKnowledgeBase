The Adguard application comprises several modules and has a broad scope of capabilities that are not limited to ad filtering. This section gives a brief overview of the Adguard for Microsoft Windows functions and features.

## Ad Blocker

This is the main module of Adguard for Windows that filters off ads on websites viewed by the user and in the user’s installed apps. Ad Blocker clears web pages of advertising images and messages using specific rules. The undesirable content is filtered even before the page is loaded in the browser, which helps save a lot of traffic.

Ad Blocker is flexibly adjusted to your needs, so you can add any object on pages you are viewing to the blocking rules, or turn off filtering on select websites. There is an option of completely halting the module and resuming its work when needed. Ad Blocker filters are updated automatically; however, you can change the User Filter parameters by editing the list of website URLs in its settings.

Adguard works well with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers, therefore Ad Blocker will successfully filter the ads in any website-viewing application you may use. For more information on Ad Blocker, visit the relevant section of our Knowledge Database.

## Browsing Security
Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing your personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they will definitely end up in the hands of criminals.

Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. In addition, the regularly updated module bases allow it to recognize malicious websites, thus securing your PC from viruses and trojans. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and Adguard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous).

Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, thus ensuring maximum protection.

## Stealth Mode
Many websites gather information about their visitors, such as their IP addresses, information about the browser and operating system installed, screen resolution, and even what page the user was redirected from. Some web pages use cookies to mark the browser and save your personal settings, user preferences, or “recognize” you upon your next visit. Stealth Mode safeguards your personal information from such data and statistics gathering systems.

You can flexibly adjust the work of Stealth Mode: for instance, you can prohibit the website to receive the search request you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete both third-party and website’s own cookies, turn off browser geolocation sharing that can be used to track your whereabouts, hide your real IP-address or even indicate one of your choice. To learn more about Stealth Mode, check out our Knowledge Database.

## Parental Control
There are numerous websites access to which should be restricted if the PC is used by children. This task is accomplished by Parental Control.

The module checks the contents of web pages opened in the browser and filters those with content undesirable for children: images and texts for adults, crude language, violence, drug propaganda, etc. Parental Control settings are password protected so that the child is not able to go round the restrictions. This module not only blocks directions to undesirable sites but can also delete the links that are inappropriate for children from the search results. Filter sensitivity is flexibly adjusted. To learn more about Parental Control, check out our Knowledge Database.

## Extensions
To make your browsing experience even more comfortable, Adguard can perform the functions of a convenient user script manager. Moreover, Adguard utilizes several browser extensions of its own.

### Adguard Assistant
The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic Adguard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. Adguard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the Adguard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. You can find detailed description of capabilities and adjustment methods of Adguard Assistant in the relevant section of our Knowledge Database.


### Adguard Popup Blocker
This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some popups are considered useful – they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the Adguard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge Database.

### Web of Trust
Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions. The site is rated by a number of specific criteria: trust, security, etc. This extension is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge Database.
