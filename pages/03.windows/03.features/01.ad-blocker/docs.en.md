The Ad Blocker module removes all ad banners and messages from web pages. The module uses special filters that are actually sets of filtering rules.

You can temporarily turn off Ad Blocker completely if necessary, or make it unblock the useful ads. This tab also allows you to access the filter editor and block log.

Adguard provides users with numerous filters that let you fine-tune blocking properties.

Filters receive automatic updates from Adguard servers. Our specialists create them all manually based on user data received. You can always help other Adguard users by sending us website URLs that you have still seen ads at.

The following filters are installed by default:

**User Filter**

A filter that you edit yourself. You can either add rules with Adguard Assistant or do it manually with the help of our rule setting guide. E.g., itâ€™s convenient against annoying pictures in forum signatures.

**Russian filter**

Rules of this filter are enough to block all ads on any Russian website.
**
English filter**

Clears ads from English websites.

**Useful ads filter**

Allows search ads and website own adverts (sales, promo offers, etc.). Which ads do we consider useful?
