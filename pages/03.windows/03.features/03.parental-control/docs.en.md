**Enable Parental Control**

Turn Parental Control on or off.

**Enable Safe Search**

Safe Search excludes adult and other content that is inappropriate for children from search results in popular search engines (Yandex, Rambler, Google, Yahoo).

**Block executable files download**

Enabling this function will make Parental Control block downloading any executable files. This option will forbid your child from downloading and installing software on the protected device.

**Sensitivity level

A password protects Adguard from change of settings or disabling. You can also use the password to access websites Parental Control has blocked.

Here you can manually add websites you thinks are inappropriate for your children.

**Manage the whitelist**

You can manually disable Parental Control for certain sites.
