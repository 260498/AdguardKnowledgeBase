The Ad Blocker module removes all ad banners and messages from web pages. The module uses special filters that are actually sets of filtering rules.

To turn Ad Blocker on or off, click on the Adguard icon in the macOS ribbon and slide the Ad Blocker switch left or right in the window that opens.

Adguard provides users with numerous filters that let you fine-tune blocking properties. Filters receive automatic updates from Adguard servers. Our specialists create them all manually based on user data received. You can always help other Adguard users by sending us website URLs that you have still seen ads at.

To turn filters on and off, click on the Filters icon in the upper section of the Adguard Settings window.

The following filters are installed and turned on by default:

**User Filter**

A filter that you edit yourself. You can either add rules with Adguard Assistant or do it manually with the help of our rule setting guide. E.g., it’s convenient against annoying pictures in forum signatures.

**Russian filter**

Rules of this filter are enough to block all ads on any Russian website.

**English filter**

Clears ads from English websites.

**Useful ads filter**

Allows search ads and website own adverts (sales, promo offers, etc.). [Which ads do we consider useful?](https://adguard.com/en/whitelist.html)

**Spyware filter**

Protects user’s personal information from spyware and statistics gathering systems by blocking relevant requests from websites.

To add a new filter to the list of active filters, click on the “+” button in the lower left corner of the Adguard Settings – Filters window. Check the filters you’d like to install in the new window and click on the Add button.
