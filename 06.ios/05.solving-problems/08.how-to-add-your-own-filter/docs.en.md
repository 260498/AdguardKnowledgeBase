Let's illustrate how to add your own DNS filter* by an example of our AdGuard SDN filter.

**⠀Don't confuse it with adding a custom filter to Safari.*

Simplified domain names (SDN) filter is composed from several other filters (English filter, Social media filter, Spyware filter, Mobile ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy) and simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking.

To enable it in AdGuard Pro, you need to take three steps:

1. Open AdGuard Pro Settings —> General —> Enable *Advanced mode*.

2. Go to DNS protection —> DNS filtering —> DNS filters —> Press *Add filter*.
