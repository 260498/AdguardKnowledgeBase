AdGuard VPN is a VPN service created by our company. An in-house developed VPN protocol makes it unique among competitors. AdGuard VPN is currently available as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox and as a mobile app for Android; apps for IOS, Mac and Windows are coming soon. Both app and extensions have a free, basic plan and a paid subscription with more possibilities.

## AdGuard VPN protocol
Some VPNs are too easy to detect which makes them vulnerable and unreliable. We took a long time to develop and deliberate over our own solution. The result was AdGuard VPN protocol, perfect for uncompromised security. It disguises itself as normal traffic, so it is much more difficult to track and block it.
## Fastest endpoints with pings

Among other things, VPN operating speed depends on the number of VPN servers and their bandwidth. AdGuard VPN has a plethora of servers with unlimited bandwidth dispersed worldwide. The closer a server is located to you, the faster the connection. The response time of each server is called a *ping* and is displayed right next to it. The top 3 fastest servers are highlighted in green, so it is very simple to pick the most optimal one.
## Subscriptions
The difference between AdGuard and AdGuard VPN payment systems is structural: there are licenses in AdGuard and subscriptions in AdGuard VPN.

As it was mentioned at the beginning of this article, there are two options: free and paid VPN. Free account allows to have:
5 devices with enabled AdGuard VPN (there can be more devices overall, but only five can be used simultaneously)
3 GB of traffic that can be distributed between AdGuard VPN extensions and app
20 Mbit/sec speed limit

Correspondingly, the paid version offers **unlimited** traffic and speed, yet the number of devices stays the same.

## Common user account/Integration with AdGuard
Finally, AdGuard VPN subscriptions are integrated in AdGuard personal account. So, if you have it, AdGuard VPN will be present [there](http://my.adguard.com/), too. A common user account is very convenient: all purchases, license keys and subscriptions will be in the same place.
# Extension-specific functions
If you look at AdGuard VPN extension for [Chrome](https://agrd.io/vpn_chrome_extension) or [Firefox](https://agrd.io/vpn_firefox_extension_beta), you might find its menu rather minimalistic. There are four tabs, two modes of operation and seven DNS servers to select from. Let’s see how it all works.
## Exclusion list and two modes of operation

The first tab *Exclusions* offers a choice of two modes: regular and selective one. Turning on Regular mode, the user can add websites to a list of exclusions: AdGuard VPN won’t run on them. And vice versa, enabling Selective mode, the user will be able to add websites to a custom list of websites where they want AdGuard VPN to work. One can easily switch between these modes, so it is very convenient to configure AdGuard VPN to your own needs.
## Block WebRTC
The second tab *Settings* features a function that blocks WebRTC – a program that allows third-party websites to ascertain user identity by detecting your real IP address. To prevent this from happening, we recommend to keep this function enabled.
## 7 DNS servers to choose from

You can choose from several available DNS servers – by [AdGuard](https://kb.adguard.com/en/dns/overview), Google, Cloudflare, Cisco, or IBM (Quad9). Some of them remove ads and trackers from your device, others enable safe search and adult content blocking, still others protect your device from malware, phishing and spyware. It is not yet possible to add a custom DNS server in extension settings, but it can be done in AdGuard VPN for Android.
