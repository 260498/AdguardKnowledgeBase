For analysis and diagnostic of different problems support service might need AdGuard log files. These files contain records about all errors occurred with the software recently. Below is the brief instruction describing the way to get the log files and send them to support service.

1. Open the AdGuard settings. Go to the General Settings section, scroll down to the end of the screen and select **Debug** Logging Level.

- Save the archive to any folder convenient for you.

5. Send the received archive to the AdGuard [support service](mailto:support@adguard.com).
