## System  requirements

**OS version:** Android 5.0 or higher.

**RAM:** at least 2 GB.

**Free disk space:** 120 Mbytes.

## Installation
Most Android-based apps are distributed via Google Play Market; however, AdGuard is not presented there, because Google prohibits distribution of network-level ad blockers via Google Play, i.e. apps that block commercials in other apps. You will find more information about Google restrictive policy [in our blog](https://blog.adguard.com/en/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play/).

That’s why you can only install AdGuard for Android manually. To use the app on your mobile device, you will need to do the following.

First of all, allow installing apps from unknown sources in your device’s OS settings. For this you will need to:

* For Android 6+: open **Settings**, then select **Additional settings** in **System & Device**. Switch on **Unknown sources** and press **OK** in the system warning window.
* For Android 5: open **Settings**, then select **Security** in the **Personal** section. Switch on **Unknown sources** and press **OK** in the system warning window.

You can now install the app on your device. Start the browser and type in the following URL: [https://adguard.com/apk](https://adguard.com/apk), or scan this QR code:

You will see the request to save the downloaded file. Press **OK**.

When the download is complete, the system will ask you if you want to install the AdGuard app. Press **Install**.

Wait for the installation procedure to finish. When it is finished, press the **Open** button. If you decide to postpone the launch of the application for another time, press **Done**.

You will then be asked to read the **License agreement** and AdGuard's privacy policy. 
You can participate in product development. 
To do this, you should check the box *"Allow AdGuard to send automatic error reports"*.
After that, you can pre-configure AdGuard protection by clicking **Continue**, or you can do it later by clicking **Skip quick settings**.

If you select the first option, a new dialog box will appear where you can configure privacy protection settings.

After pressing the **Block them** button, you will be offered to choose between three levels of protection:

- **Comfortable** (Blocks all known Analytics , reduces the time of third-party cookies).
- **High** (Reduces cookie lifetime, removes tracking parameters from URLS).
- **Ultimate** (Disables browser features that can be used for your tracking. In some cases, you may experience problems with the operation of the sites).

**High** as well as **Ultimate**  protection levels are available only in **Premium** version.


In the next window, you will be given the option to hide irritating elements such as the **Like** and **Social media Widgets**.

After selecting the last setting, you will be taken to the main menu, where you will need to create a **Local VPN connection**.

It is important to clarify that the VPN is local. That is, AdGuard filters traffic directly on your device without passing it through any remote server. After you click OK, you will see the following window.
